abstract = {An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory is a textbook intended for the graduate physics course covering relativistic quantum mechanics, quantum electrodynamics, and Feynman diagrams. The authors make these subjects accessible through carefully worked examples illustrating the technical aspects of the subject, and intuitive explanations of what is going on behind the mathematics. After presenting the basics of quantum electrodynamics, the authors discuss the theory of renormalization and its relation to statistical mechanics, and introduce the renormalization group. This discussion sets the stage for a discussion of the physical principles that underlie the fundamental interactions of elementary particle physics and their description by gauge field theories.},

abstract = { If it is to be true that the history of the universe should be adjusted to minimize the "imaginary part of action" [arXiv:0802.2991, arXiv:0711.3080, arXiv:0707.1919, arXiv:hep-ph/0612032, arXiv:hep-th/0509205, arXiv:hep-th/0701018], it would be "easiest" to have this "imaginary part of the action" to be rather independent of whether the neutrons are converted to electrons and protons (and neutrinos), and therefore of whether the contribution to the imaginary part of the Lagrangian were conserved under this conversion. Under the further assumption - which is reasonable - that the by far dominant term in the imaginary part of the Lagrangian density is the one corresponding to the Higgs mass square term in the Standard Model Lagrangian density mH**2 |phi(x)|**2 we derive a relation: (down mass square minus up mass square) = constituent quark mass times electron mass/"ln", where "ln" is defined by <1/gamma >= "ln"/ < gamma > and is of the order of 1 to 4, where gamma stands for relativity gamma of a valence quark inside a nucleon. This relation is very well satisfied with the phenomeno- logically estimated current algebra quark masses mu, md, and the constituent mass mconstituent for the light quarks, taken say to be one third of the nucleon mass. Our model has been criticised on the ground that it should have prevented cosmic rays with energies capable of producing Higgs particles, when hitting say the atmosphere. Indeed there is, however, a well known "knee" in the density curve as function of energy at an order of magnitude for the cosmic ray particle energy close to the effective threshold for Higgs production. A parameter giving the order of magnitude of number of Higgsses to be produced in order to get a significant effect is estimated to be about 300000. },

abstract = { We want to unify usual equation of motion laws of nature with "laws" about initial conditions, second law of thermodynamics, cosmology. By introducing an imaginary part - of a similar form but different parameters as the usual real part - for the action to be used in the Feynmann path way integral we obtain a model determining (not only equations of motion but) also the initial conditions, for say a quantum field theory. We set up the formalism for e.g. expectation values, classical approximation in such a model and show that provided the imaginary part gets unimportant except in the Big Bang era the model can match the usual theory. Speculatively requiring that there be place for Dirac strings and thus in principle monopoles in the model we can push away the effects of the imaginary part to be involved only with particles not yet found. Most promising for seeing the initial condition determining effects from the imaginary part is thus the Higgs particle. We predict that the width of the Higgs particle shall likely turn out to be (appreciably perhaps) broader than calculated by summing usual decay rates. Higgs machines will be hit by bad luck. },

abstract = { We develop some formalism which is very general Feynman path integral in the case of the action which is allowed to be complex. The major point is that the effect of the imaginary part of the action (mainly) is to determine which solution to the equations of motion gets realized. We can therefore look at the model as a unification of the equations of motion and the ``initial conditions". We have already earlier argued for some features matching well with cosmology coming out of the model. A Hamiltonian formalism is put forward, but it still has to have an extra factor in the probability of a certain measurement result involving the time after the measurement time. A special effect to be discussed is a broadening of the width of the Higgs particle. We reach crudely a changed Breit-Wigner formula that is a normalized square root of the originally expected one },

abstract = { It is shown that the transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics being referred back to Feynman-Wheeler's time reversal symmetric radiation theory has reminiscences to our complex action model. In this complex action model the initial conditions are in principle even calculable. Thus it philosophically points towards superdeterminism, but really the Bell theorem problem is solved in our model of complex action by removing the significance of signals running slower than by light velocity.  Our model as earlier published predicts that LHC should have some failure before reaching to have produced as many Higgs-particles as would have been produced the SSC accelerator. In the present article, we point out that a cardgame involving whether to restrict LHC-running as we have proposed to test our model will under all circumstances be a success. },

abstract = { We review slightly a work by Horowitz and Maldecena solving the information loss problem for black holes by having inside the blackhole - near to the singularity - a boundary condition, as e.g the no boundary proposal by Hartle and Hawking. Here we propose to make this boundary condition come out of our imaginary action model (together with Masao Ninomiya). This model naturally begins effectively to set up boundaries - whether it be in future or past! - especially strongly whenever we reach to high energy physics regimes, such as near the black hole singularity, or in Higgs producing machines as LHC or SSC. In such cases one can say our model predicts miracles. The point is that you may say that the information loss problem, unless you solve it in other ways, call for such a violation of time causality as in our imaginary action model! },

abstract = { We review a work by M.Ninomiya and myself about a model for the initial state - i.e. which solution to the equations of motions - that is being realized. The to be realized solution is suggeted to be the one for which a certain number depending on the whole history of the development of the whole Unverse is minimal. This number is called "the imaginary part of the action" and since this article is meant to be somewhat popular the concept of an action is suggestively explained. At first the model of ours give too many miracles, but we believe to have argued that the number of miracles is drastically reduced so the model is not immediately excluded from having a chance of being true. A suggested miracle that has occured is the stopping by the US Congress of the large accelerator SSC under construction already in Texas. A similar bad fait is predicted for the soon to start accelerator LHC in Geneva! By translation submission it has still not started up to its proper energy per particle. },

abstract = { We have earlier proposed the idea of making card drawing experiment of which outcome potentially decides whether Large Hadron Collider (LHC for short) should be closed or not. The purpose is to test theoretical models which, like e.g. our own model that has an imaginary part of the action with much a similar form to that of the real part. The imaginary part has influence on the initial conditions not only in the past but even from the future. It was speculated that all accelerators producing large amounts of Higgs particles like the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC for short) would call for initial conditions to have been so arranged as to finally not allow these accelerators to come to work. If there were such effects we could perhaps provoke a very clear cut "miracle" by having the effect make the drawn card be the one closing LHC. Here we shall, however, discuss that a total closing is hardly needed and seek to calculate how one could perform checking experiment for the proposed type of influence from future to be made in the statistically least disturbing and least harmful way.  We shall also discuss how to extract most information about our effect or model in the unlikely case that a card restricting the running of LHC or the Tevatron would be drawn at all, by estimating say the relative importance of high beam energy or of high luminosity for the purpose of our effect. },

abstract = { In this lecture a short introduction is given into the theory of the Feynman path integral in quantum mechanics. The general formulation in Riemann spaces will be given based on the Weyl- ordering prescription, respectively product ordering prescription, in the quantum Hamiltonian. Also, the theory of space-time transformations and separation of variables will be outlined. As elementary examples I discuss the usual harmonic oscillator, the radial harmonic oscillator, and the Coulomb potential. Lecture given at the graduate college ''Quantenfeldtheorie und deren Anwendung in der Elementarteilchen- und Festk{\"o}rperphysik'', Universit{\"a}t Leipzig, 16-26 November 1992. },
